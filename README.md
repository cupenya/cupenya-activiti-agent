# cupenya-activiti-agent

We are still working on the tutorial, currently two things are missing that for an easy start, we are working on getting them done by end of this week.

Anyone who wants to try it please download this dependency and cupenya-agent-common, as it is not yet in maven central.

Integrate the CupenyaParseHandler as a Post Parse listener in your config.

Use the https://github.com/cupenya/bluemix-order-entry tutorial to get set up with an account and an API key.

We provide hands on support at any time through mail (support@cupenya.com) or live through gitter.
